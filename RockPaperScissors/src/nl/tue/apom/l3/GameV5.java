 * Rock/paper/scissors game where two computer bots compete without user input.
 * This variant uses two stubbern computer implementations that will naively 
 * battle each other by looking at the other one's last attempt.
 * 
 * Because of that approach, the program will loop infinitely as soon as they 
 * make an initial choice that is identical (e.g., twice Scissors).
